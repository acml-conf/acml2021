We invite applications to attend the [Online Asian Machine Learning School]({{site.baseurl|append:"/school/"}}) (OA<up>M</up>LS), which is a part of the [Asian Conference on Machine Learning 2021]({{site.baseurl}}) and will be held from November 8 to November 19, 2021.

By participating in OA<up>M</up>LS, you will have the opportunity to:
* Learn from and engage with top experts in the field. OA<up>M</up>LS offers an invaluable chance to study fundamentals of machine learning as well as state-of-the-art advances from our [invited speakers]({{site.baseurl|append:"/school/speakers/"}}).
* OA<up>M</up>LS provides a great networking opportunity to meet like-minded individuals who share your passion for machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence.
* Attend ACML 2021, which is held immediately after the summer school.


We aim to have 200 strongly motivated and engaged participants in this event. We encourage applications from the Asia-Pacific region, although we open applications to anyone in the world provided that they will be able to attend the event which will be held in Asian time zones. No deep experience of machine learning is needed to apply, but participants are assumed to have some basic knowledge of programming, statistics, and machine learning. We will provide recommended background materials for those who are selected to ensure that everyone has the required knowledge to benefit from the event.
