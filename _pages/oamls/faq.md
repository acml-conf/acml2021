1. **What is the schedule like?**

    We are still working on the schedule. The last 3 days will be reserved for the conference and will follow the conference schedule. For the school, the main lectures and other activities will be scheduled from 9am to 6pm Singapore time on the weekdays. We may make exceptions for cases where the speakers from a different timezone cannot fit into the schedule.

2. **What are the topics covered?**

    The topics would roughly include Bayesian machine learning, generalisation theory, optimisation theory, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, optimal transport, trustworthy ML, machine learning for computer vision, machine learning for NLP, commonsense learning, graph learning, unsupervised/meta learning, computational biology, and causality, although the speakers may change what they speak about specifically.
